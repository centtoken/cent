# Cent (Token)

Cent is a decentralized stablecoin with a real world value of 1Â¢, equivalent to 0.01 USD.

Cent is crypto-collateralized.

Each Cent token is directly backed with 0.01 DAI.

A Cent token is equivalent to and is pegged to the value of 1/100 DAI

Being backed with DAI, another decentralized cryptocurrency, Cent is a great choice for those who want protection against volatility of standard cryptocurrencies, along with the freedom and privacy of decentralization of finance.

Cent is completely open source, and can be audited, or modified freely by anyone.

# Responsible, Reliable, Secure, Decentralized Reserves.

All Cent Token reserves are fully decentralized and consist entirely of MakerDao DAI stablecoins.

Cent Token reserves' assets are distributed geographically and organisationally.

The majority (no less than 65%) of Cent Token reserves' private keys are held 100% offline through cold storage technology in bank-grade Class III vaults on an SOC 2 Type 2 certified platform.

All Cent Token Reserves kept in offline Cold-Storage are placed under significantly greater protection from:
 - Third-party hacks, copying, or theft of private keys.
 - Loss of keys
 
 Non-Cold-Storage Reserves of Cent Token are managed securely and decentrally on warm wallets, ethereum smart contracts, and on DeFi protocols such as UniSwap.
 
 Non-Cold-Storage Reserves, highlighted above, include no more than 35% of total combined funds of all Cold & Warm/Hot storage reserves.
 
 Non-Cold-Storage Reserves, like all Cent Token Reserves, are handled as securely as possible. 
 Unfortanately, warm wallets, especially hot wallets of DeFi protocols, may be more susceptible to exploit attacks; and cannot be insured against hacks nor theft. Although risks of loss are higher with hot wallets, damage potentials are minimized through decentralization, and through minimal internet exposure of funds (funds are added to UniSwap, and other protocols as needed).

# Purchasing Cent Tokens | How DAI is sent to reserves and to DeFi protocols.

*Currently, the Cent Token contract, which includes the currency (Cent Token) and the purchase portal, has not been yet been deployed. Transaction fees needed to deploy, will be paid with contributions made through Cent Token's Gitcoin Grant, listed below, in the "Useful Links" section.

Cent tokens can be purchased with Ethereum & over 40 major ERC20 tokens.
Through the on-chain liquidity pool of the DeFi protocol, Kyber Network, Ethereum and ERC20 tokens used to purchase Cent Tokens are instantly converted into DAI.
Tokens will be sent to purchaser, collected DAI will be sent to a transfer wallet, then to be stored on reserve wallets for and/or added onto DeFi exchanges/protocols such as UniSwap.

# What is Cent Token's revenue model? | How is revenue used?

Cent Token relies mainly on contributions from the community.

Contributions include funding and participating/volunteering in our development and project growth community and bounties.

Cent Token is a not-for-profit project.

Cent Token generates funding by selling newly issued Cent Tokens at a rate of 1 Cent Token for 0.01 DAI.

Minor income may be generated through protocols similar to UniSwap; as the Cent Token acts a major liquidity provider of DAI/Cent Token for trades involving Cent Token on UniSwap; and small percentage fees are rewarded to liquidity providers on UniSwap.

Cent Token may also generate up to 1% interest on funds held in the segregated hot-wallet reserves.

We do not mainly profit from interest on the majority of our reserves, as most of our backing reserve wallets are kept offline and in cold-storage (highlighted above), and interest is only generated on the minority of Cent Token's hot-wallet reserves.

Cent Token uses generated revenue, and contributions of funding, towards rewarding contributors and community members for bounties, and towards maintaining/expanding the project.

Some examples of how Cent Token's revenue is utilized are listed below:

- Funding bounties and bug-bounties.
- Producing additional, strengthened reserve backing of Cent Tokens.
- Paying for needed services/products to run the project. (Examples include: Insurance Costs, Cold-Storage Fees, Transaction Fees, Other Expenses).
