# Cent (Token)

Cent is a decentralized stablecoin with a real world value of 1Â¢, equivalent to 0.01 USD.

Cent is crypto-collateralized.

Each Cent token is directly backed with 0.01 DAI.

A Cent token is equivalent to and is pegged to the value of 1/100 DAI

Being backed with DAI, another decentralized cryptocurrency, Cent is a great choice for those who want protection against volatility of standard cryptocurrencies, along with the freedom and privacy of decentralization of finance.

Cent is completely open source, and can be audited, or modified freely by anyone.

# Responsible, Reliable, Secure, Decentralized Reserves.

All Cent Token reserves are fully decentralized and consist entirely of MakerDao DAI stablecoins.

Cent Token reserves' assets are distributed geographically and organisationally.

When a Cent Token is issued via purchase from the CENT purchase portal, liquidity is added to UniSwap.

DeFi smart contracts and protocols, such as UniSwap, act as decentralized reserves which also provide instant redemption/exchange of Cent Tokens.

# Token Specs

Decimals: 0

Token type: Crypto-Collateralized Stablecoin

Token Price: Priced at 0.01 DAI (0.01 USD)

Maximum Token Supply: Equivalent to 100 times the maximum total supply of DAI.

# Purchasing Cent Tokens | How DAI is sent to reserves and to DeFi protocols.

Cent Token's purchase portal, where users can purchase newly issued tokens, is integrated with DeFi protocols such as Kyber Network.

This means CENT tokens can be purchased with Ethereum & over 40 major ERC20 tokens.

Through the on-chain liquidity pool of the DeFi protocol, Kyber Swap, Ethereum and ERC20 tokens used to purchase Cent Tokens are instantly converted into DAI.
Tokens will be sent to purchaser, collected DAI will be sent to a transfer wallet, then to be stored on reserve wallets for and/or added onto DeFi exchanges/protocols such as UniSwap.

# What is Cent Token's revenue model? | How is revenue used?

Cent Token relies mainly on contributions from the community.

Contributions include funding and participating/volunteering in our development and project growth community and bounties.

Cent Token is a not-for-profit project.

Some revenue may be generated through protocols similar to UniSwap.

Because Cent Token acts a major liquidity provider of the pair, DAI/CENT, for trades involving Cent Token on UniSwap, a small percentage of fees is rewarded to liquidity providers, including Cent Token, on UniSwap.

Cent Token uses generated revenue, and contributions of funding, towards rewarding contributors and community members for bounties, and towards maintaining/expanding the project.

Some examples of how Cent Token's revenue is utilized are listed below:

- Funding bounties and bug-bounties.
- Producing additional backing of Cent Tokens.
- Expanding CENT as a project.
