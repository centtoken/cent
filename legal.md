# Cent Token Risk Factors

* The following list of risks associated with Cent Token is not exhaustive.
* No guarantee of price stability

When Cent Token tokenizes DAI for CENT, it will always do so at a rate of one hundredth of a DAI (1 $DAI) per one (1) CENT and when Cent Token redeems CENT for DAI, it will always redeem such CENT at a rate of one DAI (1 DAI) per one (1) CENT, fees may be applicable.

For each CENT that is issued by Cent Token and remains in circulation, Cent Token will maintain the equivalent of 0.01 DAI in decentralized reserve accounts, on behalf of, and for the benefit of, Cent Token users.

Cent Token believes these actions will promote the price stability of CENT with an intended goal of one (1) CENT being worth one hundredth of a DAI (0.01 DAI). However, this does not guarantee that the value of one (1) CENT will always equal one hundredth of a DAI (0.01 DAI).  

Due to a variety of factors outside of Cent Tokenâ€™s control, the value of CENT, particularly on third-party platforms such as cryptocurrency exchange platforms, can fluctuate above or below one hundredth of a DAI (0.01 DAI). Cent Token cannot control how third parties value CENT, and Cent Token is not responsible for any losses or other issues that may result from fluctuations in the value of CENT.
