# Cent Token Risk Factors

***The following list of risks associated with Cent Token is not exhaustive.***

#

**No Guarantee of Price Stability**

When Cent Token tokenizes DAI for CENT, it will always do so at a rate of one hundredth of a DAI (1 $DAI) per one (1) CENT and when Cent Token redeems CENT for DAI, it will always redeem such CENT at a rate of one DAI (1 DAI) per one (1) CENT, fees may be applicable.

For each CENT that is issued by Cent Token and remains in circulation, Cent Token will maintain the equivalent of 0.01 DAI in decentralized reserve accounts, on behalf of, and for the benefit of, Cent Token users.

Cent Token believes these actions will promote the price stability of CENT with an intended goal of one (1) CENT being worth one hundredth of a DAI (0.01 DAI). However, this does not guarantee that the value of one (1) CENT will always equal one hundredth of a DAI (0.01 DAI).  

Due to a variety of factors outside of Cent Token’s control, the value of CENT, particularly on third-party platforms such as cryptocurrency exchange platforms, can fluctuate above or below one hundredth of a DAI (0.01 DAI). Cent Token cannot control how third parties value CENT, and Cent Token is not responsible for any losses or other issues that may result from fluctuations in the value of CENT.

**Third-Party Platforms**

CENT is based on open source software and runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means that third parties can elect to support CENT on their platforms without any authorization or approval by Cent Token or anyone else.  

As a result, CENT support on any third-party platform does not imply any endorsement by Cent Token that such third-party services are valid, legal, stable or otherwise appropriate. Cent Token is not responsible for any losses or other issues you might encounter using CENT on non-Cent-Token platforms.

Users accept all consequences of sending CENT off of Cent Token’s platforms. 

CENT transactions are not reversible. 

Once you send CENT to an address, you accept the risk that you may lose access to, and any claim on, that CENT indefinitely or permanently. 

For example, an address may have been entered incorrectly and the true owner of the address may never be discovered, you may not have (or subsequently lose) the private key associated with such address, an address may belong to an entity that will not return the CENT, an address belongs to an entity that may return the CENT but first requires action on your part, such as verification of your identity. 

For the avoidance of doubt, and centralization, nothing in this agreement is intended to obligate CENT to track, verify or determine the provenance of CENT balances for Users, including any form of security interests claimed thereon.

**Software Protocols and Operational Challenges**

You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. 
Cent Token may experience sophisticated cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity or other operational or technical difficulties that may cause interruptions to the CENT Services. 

You understand that the CENT Services may experience operational issues that lead to delays, including delays in redeeming CENT. 

You agree to accept the risk of transaction failure resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated attacks. 

You agree not to hold Cent Token accountable for any related losses.

**Compliance**

You are responsible for complying with applicable law. 

You agree that Cent Token is not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to your transactions, including tax laws. 

You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of the CENT Services, including any accurate reporting of the tax or legal status of CENT in your jurisdiction.

**No Deposit Insurance**

CENT held in your wallet(s) are not subject to deposit insurance protection, including, but not limited to, where your country of residence is the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections; or where your country of residence is outside of the United States, the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation, or equivalent scheme in your country of residence.

Since CENT is entirely crypto-collateralized and is fully decentralized, it cannot be insured in such centralized methods described above.

**Legal treatment of CENT transfers**

The regulatory status of CENT and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. 

It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to CENT, blockchain technology, and its applications. 

Accordingly, it is not possible to determine whether a CENT transfer would be recognized under applicable law by a court or regulator at the U.S. state, U.S. federal, or international level.

**On-Chain Transactions Irreversible**

When CENT is sent out of your Ethereum ERC20 wallet(s) to a third-party CENT address, such transaction is completed on the Ethereum blockchain. 

This means that such transaction is irreversible and Cent Token does not have the ability to reverse or recall any transaction once initiated.

You bear all responsibility for any losses that might be incurred as a result of sending CENT to an incorrect or unintended CENT address.
